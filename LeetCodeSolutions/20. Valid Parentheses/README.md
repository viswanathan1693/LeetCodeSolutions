# Valid Parentheses

To solve this problem, you can use a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. 
When a closing bracket is encountered, check if it matches the top element of the stack (which should be the most recent opening bracket). 
If it does match, pop the opening bracket from the stack and continue.
If it doesn't match, return False since the brackets are not properly balanced.
If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding 
closing brackets and the input string is valid. If the stack is not empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets and the 
input string is not valid.

In this program, we use a Stack<char> to keep track of the opening parentheses, braces, and brackets that we encounter. 
We also use a Dictionary<char, char> to map each closing symbol to its corresponding opening symbol.
We then iterate over each character in the input string s. If the character is a closing symbol, 
we check if the top of the stack matches its corresponding opening symbol using the mapping dictionary. 
If the top of the stack doesn't match, or the stack is empty, we return false because the string is not valid. 
If the character is an opening symbol, we push it onto the stack.
Finally, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, the string is valid because all opening symbols have been matched with their 
corresponding closing symbols. If it is not empty, the string is not valid because there are unmatched opening symbols.
